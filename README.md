# Next.js MongoDB Meetup App
## This is my meetup app built in Next.js, React, SCSS modules & MongoDB
### It serves as a CRUD app with a serverless solution which allows users to upload meetups with an image to a MongoDB database. Sockets are implemented on specific routes in order to collect the appropriate data

Users can view meetups, edit unprotected meetups, add new unprotected meetups and delete unprotected meetups.

The protected meetups act as example cards for visitors to the site.
